# Advanced Ontology Engineering
30 classes, 25 properties. Use owl2 properties and ontology design patterns. 

## Ontology deveopment 101 steps
According to [Ontology Development 101: A Guide to Creating YourFirst Ontology](https://protege.stanford.edu/publications/ontology_development/ontology101.pdf)
### Step 1. Determine the domain and scope of the ontology
### Step 2. Skip
### Step 3. Enumerate important terms in the ontology
### Step 4. Define the classes and the class hierarchy
### Step 5. Define the properties of classesâ€”slots
### Step 6. Define the facets of the slots


## OWL2 Feautres
During ontology engineering, make use of advanced modelling features offered
by OWL2 (refer to lecture 2).

## Ontology Design Patterns
Additionally, illustrate the use of at least 3 different Ontology
Design Patterns (ODPs). These can be selected from those described during the lecture or
from the ODP [website](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Main_Page)




## Data Sources
We use the following two datasources

### PlayMyData
PlayMyData is a multi-purpose, comprehensive videogame dataset of videogames released from 1993 up to November 2023. It contains metadata like titles, platforms, a summary of the story, and release data. It also integrates data from HowLongToBeat on completion times.
